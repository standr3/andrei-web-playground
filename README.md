# 🕹️ Andrei's Web Playground

Welcome to **Andrei’s Web Playground** — a growing collection of interactive and visual demos for front-end development.  
This project is both a personal learning tool and a community resource for exploring core concepts in **HTML**, **CSS**, and eventually **JavaScript / React**.

> **Status:** 🧪 Work in Progress – structure and content are evolving.
